What is hub.docker.com ??
It is like github where public containers are there.

Docker --- containers and images

images are like OS .. to run the images we need container.


docker container ls -a
docker container ls
docker start [containername] // to start the container from terminal
docker stop  [containername]
docker exec [containername] ls
docker exec it [containername] ls //we will be inside the container


To check the docker images:
docker -images
docker run -it [imagename]

port expose:
docker run it -p 1025:1025 mailhog/mailhog
